# Plug and Play GAN-like Image Denoising

This code is meant to add noise to a given image, and employs a GAN-like model to denoise the image.

## Contents
- 'imagedenoising2.py': Implements the model class, loads the image, and trains the model for denoising
- 'results': Folder containing the figure the script produces, and denoised image evaluation metrics

## TODO
- Add training loss graph
- Verify I can save a model from a previous run
- Implement a discriminator
